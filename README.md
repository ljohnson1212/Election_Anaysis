Election Audit Summary

	Using this script was effective while using this for a county election, but with some modifications this could be used for small city elections and larger state elections. The script provides feedback on the total votes and the percentage each candidate receives. But there is more information that could be helpful to the election committee and the candidates. One adjustment could be to produce a code to show how many votes each candidate received in each county. We know how many votes were received in each county and we know how many votes each candidate received. But it will also be helpful to break down how many votes each candidate received in those counties. This could help with future campaigns to see if a candidate needs to promote more time to a certain county. Another one is by adjusting the variable from county_votes to state_votes, this could provide a wider perspective on election results and the turnout of each county, city, or district. So if the candidate wants to move up to a higher office, they can have an idea on how they would perform is a wider area than just the counties in this analysis.
